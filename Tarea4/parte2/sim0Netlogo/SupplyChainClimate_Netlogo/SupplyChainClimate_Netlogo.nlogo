## WHAT IS IT?

This model explores potential market dynamics of a physical supply chain in response to climate change policies and climate change risks. The intent if the tool is tool inform scenario analyses on the influence of these policies and risks versus outcomes in the market - such as market size, profits, and greenhouse gas (ghg) emission levels, etc. The market sits on a shoreline where fims must balance the risks of sea level rise (long-term climate change risk) and hurricanes (a proxy for any potentially damaging short-term weather event, the frequency and intensity of which are influenced by climate change), versus the risk of not receiving work due to policies against high emissions intensity when locating themselves too far from the clients (on the shoreline).

## HOW TO USE IT

###A. Set Up and Initialize the Run
####1. _setup_ : button to set up the firms
####2. _go_ : button to start the simulation

###B. Choose the Market
####1. _number-firms_ : slider to chose the total market size
####2. _initial-shoreline-development-selector_ : switch to turn ON/OFF preferential tratment for shoreline development
####3. _initial-shoreline-preference slider_ : adjusts the preference for shoreline development
>  1 - 4  : prefer development away from the shore ( 1 = farthest from shore )
>  5      : neutral development preference ( same as above switch set to OFF )
>  6 - 25 : prefer development close to the shore ( 25 = closest to the shore )

###C. Set Business Costs
####1. _maintenance-cost_ : slider to set operational costs not related to climate
####2. _cost-to-move_: slider to set cost incurred to move the business location

###D. Adjust Sea Level Rise (SLR) Parameters
####1. _slr-on-?_ : switch to turn ON/OFF slr
####2. _sea-level-rise-rate_ : slider to set rate of slr

###E. Adjust Hurricane Parameters
####1. _hurricanes-on-?_ : switch to turn ON/OFF hurricanes
####2. _increasing-hurricane-intensity_ : slider to set increasing hurricane intensity over time due to climate chance
####3. _increasing-hurricane-frequency_ : slider to set increasing hurricane frequency over time due to climate chance

###F. Adjust Policy Parameter
####1. _ghg-policy-strength_ : slider to choose the strength of ghg regulation

## THINGS TO NOTICE

###A. Where Do Firms Locate Themselves Over Time?

Are firms concentrating on the shore, away from the shore, or in the middle? Or are they well distributed across the landscape? Has this involved a large transition from the original positioning? Who is the oldest survivor and what is interesting about their starting and current attributes?

###B. How Robust is the Market?

Have your settings caused instability or large losses of firms in a short window of time? Are the firms generating sufficient income and leading to a large overall market value? Is this the case for this run only or do additional runs end with the  same results?

###C. How Intense are GHG Emissions?

Have emissions evened out or are they rather dynamic? How does this correspond with the location of the firms across the landscape? Does it make sense with the settings you have in place? At what rate do GHG emissions change in comparison with other indicators?

## THINGS TO TRY

###A. Play with the Switches

Examine what happens to the market when you add and subtract climate risk from the calculations. If you remove both, is there still a way for agents to fail and perish?

###B. Play with the Sliders

See which sliders make the largest difference in market functionality and GHG emission consequences. Note interaction between different sliders and any setting that tend to cause volatility in the model run.

###C. Try Different Market Arrangements

Adjust the size of the market and the original proclivity for coastal development. See if these differences alter the overall functionality of the market or if they only adjust the relative magnitude of the results.

###D. Run a Parameter Sweep

Parameter sweeps with this model take a very long time due to the nature of climate change modeling (on the order of many years). See if any interesting dynamics come in to play with a widely applicable parameter sweep.


## EXTENDING THE MODEL

###A. Transporation Networks

Currently, trucks move directly to the shore and back to the parent firm. Increased depth of understanding may evolve from considering spatial factors relating to roadway networks and bottle-necks, as well as the use of other modes of transportation (such as freight or airplanes).

###B. Adaptive Policy

Policy levers are very abrupt and it would be interesting to see what the implications of lag time and/or adaptive policy has on the market. This could be conducted manually by moving the lever when either market or emission signals hit certain levels.

###C. Network Effects

Firms do not make choices in a vacuum and it would be interesting to see how collusion and risk pooling might affect market dynamics.

###D. Other Climate Effects

Taking the y-axis as a north-south indicator, it would be interesting to see what would happen if temperature changes were considered in the calculation methodologies. It would also be nice to incorporate precipitation cycles; however, adding too many additional considerations is likely to favor needless complication of instructive complexity.


## NETLOGO FEATURES

Note the extensive use of normal distributions with very wide tails in this application. This plays to the dynamics of business decision making as well as climate - there is significant variability around these parameters despite a fairly normal decision pathway when averaged at the macro level.
